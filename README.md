# Market-Basket-Analysis 

An analysis of transaction data to uncover patterns and associations between items using market basket analysis techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains python script for performing market basket analysis usisn apriori algorithm. This project explores transactional data to identify frequent itemsets and association rules. The analysis aims to provide insights into item relationships, popular product, and potential recommendations.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the data.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   - Ensure that the date column is in a datetime format.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Calculate summary statistics to understand the distribution of member numbers.
   - Analyze the variety of items in the item description.
   - Explore trends over time.
  
3. **Visualization:**
   - Histogram illustrating the distribution of basket sizes in the dataset, showing average number of items in each member's transaction basket. 
   - Bar charts highlighting item frequencies, transaction patterns and other insights.
 
4. **Market Basket Analysis:**
   - Application of Apriori algorithm to generate association rules and discover frequent itemsets. 
   - Set a minimum support threshold to filter out infrequent itemsets.

5. **Interpretation and Insights:**
   - evaluate association rules.


## Project Structure

- **Code:** Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- **Documentation:** Well-documented Jupyter Notebooks explaining each step of the analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Images or notebooks containing visualizations supporting the analysis.


## Usage

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook market_basket_analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis.
